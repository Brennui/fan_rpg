# Untitled RPG Project

The world is in ruins. Remnants of a lost age are all that remain, aside from a handful of towns that have been lucky enough to survive, although barely. Prophecy tells of a person of immense power who, when the time comes, will be asked to give up that power and restore the world from the brink. That time is coming. The choice is yours. What will you do?

This project aims to utilize both modern and retro rpg mechanics to tell an original story, using the variety of tools provided by Python, SQLAlchemy, and Panda3D, among a number of other technologies. Stay tuned for updates!

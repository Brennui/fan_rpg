terminal-run text-based rpg to later be expanded with visuals in whatever forms that takes

basic concept - player is a powerful something who has to slowly sacrafice that power to save/protect the world, getting incrimentally weaker through the game. random encounters will feature classics like slimes, rats, monsters. They'll be encountered backwards with e.g. rats at the end.

#give this exposition a bit later

This age is over. No longer will you (the player) control magic. In the next age, magic will belong to all. It will be an age of chaos, an age of freedom. It will be a glorious age indeed. But one without a watchman.

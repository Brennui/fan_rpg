terminal-run text-based rpg to later be expanded with visuals in whatever forms that takes

basic concept - player is a powerful something who has to slowly sacrafice that power to save/protect the world, getting incrimentally weaker through the game. random encounters will feature classics like slimes, rats, monsters. They'll be encountered backwards with e.g. rats at the end.
